DAViCal for Debian
----------------

This is a CalDAV Server which I wrote because I was getting
sick of the length of time it was taking to make worthwhile
CalDAV server-side implementations that worked OK with
Evolution.

Then, when I finally did find a CalDAV store that worked, I
found that it was quite bloated because it wanted to do vast
amounts of irrelevant stuff.  Well, irrelevant for me in any
case.
