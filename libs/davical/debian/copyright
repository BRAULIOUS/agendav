License for Translation Building code
=====================================
The following files inherit their license separately:
   scripts/po/extract.pl
   scripts/po/rebuild-translations.sh

The process used for building the translations for DAViCal is based on
prior code originally from the Horde project and subsequently from the
Gallery project.  It has also been somewhat further modified here.

The applicable Horde license is the LGPL, as identified here:
